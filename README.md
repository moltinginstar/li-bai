This project is a web-based tool that allows users to convert Mandarin Chinese pinyin into Armenian based on my own transcription scheme. It’s meant to be a system for *transcription* rather than exact, unambiguous *transliteration*. The Armenian script cannot handle tone marks or other diacritics, and in general it wouldn’t be used for linguistic or scientific work.

I wrote this in an afternoon for a class project, so it’s rather basic at the moment. Notably it’s missing [*érhuà*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhua), which is included in my transcription scheme. I may come back to finish it off when I get a round tuit, but those are in painfully short supply right now.
